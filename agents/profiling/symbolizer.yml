    # Control the verification of Elasticsearch certificates. Valid values are:
    # * full, which verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a trusted
    # authority (CA) and also verifies that the server's hostname (or IP address)
    # matches the names identified within the certificate.
    # * strict, which verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a trusted
    # authority (CA) and also verifies that the server's hostname (or IP address)
    # matches the names identified within the certificate. If the Subject Alternative
    # Name is empty, it returns an error.
