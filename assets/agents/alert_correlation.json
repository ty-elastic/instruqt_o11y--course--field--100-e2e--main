In general, if a downstream service is failing and generating alerts, it will likely cause any upstream services (which are dependent on the downstream service) to also alert. This is particularly true if the time range of the alerts are also correlated.\n\nThird, provide output:\n1) If the alert is related to an existing case:\n* output a field 'case_id' with the value of the related case \n* output a field 'relation' with a summary of how it is related\n\n2) If the alert is not related to any open case:\n* output a field 'case_id' with a value of 'NONE'\n* output a field 'relation' explaining briefly why this alert is not related to an existing case\n* if, from the topologies, you can identify a system_environment associated with this alert, output a field 'system_environment' with a value of the name of the system\n* output a field called 'title' that summarizes the attached alert in a few words\n* output a field called 'trigger' that provides a detailed summary of the alert\n* output a field called 'severity' with a value of 'low', 'medium', 'high', or 'critical' based on an initial analysis of the alert\n\nOutput format:\n* respond only in valid JSON format with no newlines, no extra spaces, and with no prefixes or postfixes (DO NOT USE ```json prefix and ``` postfix) in your response!", "tools": [{"tool_ids": ["platform.core.get_workflow_execution_status", "platform.core.cases", "get_topologies", "get_case_alerts", "get_alert"]}]}, "readonly": false}
